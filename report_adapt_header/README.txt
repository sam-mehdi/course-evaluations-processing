Default input/output folders: headers_input / headers_output

Put input/base headers in headers_input
NOTE: The input header should have all headings in 1 column, NOT 1 row.

run in cmd: py adapt_header.py 

headers_output is where the final headers will be.

Next, create the index lists from these header files.

NOTE: These output headers should then go into the Header Files folder in report processing 20202. They are NOT named correctly.
See "report_processing_20202 \ Example Input \ Header Files \" for correct naming procedure. Nonetheless, the file format should work.
